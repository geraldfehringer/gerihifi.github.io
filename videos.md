## YouTube Channel's
<br />

My curated YouTube channel list I follow and reason why. \
I do not follow people who are just comparing new hifi gear. \
I stop avoiding this purchasing-hamster-wheel. \
**Getting the best system in the world for yourself, means: tune it**!

>>Janos is based in Hawaii and is for me **_the HiFi-Mentor_**!
>>He has such a knowledgeable person, without working in the industry & try to sell something
>>I've not find any serious Audiophile YouTuber, coming closely to what Janos is doing
>>YES, sometimes very hard to follow, but on the other hand: **if you wanna build the best system
>>in the world, you need to understand a lot of HiFi & music aspects!**
