**Questions, questions ....**

As I like simple and clean Hifi-chains, as well proper cabling - it was obvious that I need some decent rack to place the equipment in a sonic-optimal and safe way.

>>**:notes: Research STEP #1: Let's see what's the Hifi market offers, from simple to more advanced ones.

I realized the usual vendors like Solidsteel, State of the Art, Creaktiv or Solid Tech looked somehow similar. On the other hand very _cold design_ as many of them use mainly metal, which I don't like at all.

It was also interesting to experience real issues, to find a rack with some decent sized plates! What I mean with that?

- I need enough space for modern Hifi equipment, like placing an bigger solid AMP (e.g. my Rotel Michi X5)
- I wanna have enough space left on the plate, behind the equipment to place HighEnd cabling safely (e.g.: bigger power-outlets)
- HiFi chassis do have all kind of sizes and especially chassis-depth
- Of course stable standing, solid material and modular to add/remove levels
- Using material which are not resonating by default, like glass or metal
- ...always quite important: must fit our living room :smile:

**Size matters!!**
