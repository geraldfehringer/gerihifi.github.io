**Questions, questions ....**

As I like simple and clean Hifi-chains, as well proper cabling - it was obvious that I need some decent rack to place the equipment in a sonic-optimal and safe way.

**Question 1:** **Why do I need one?** - if you care about your equipment, it should be placed properly. Also from an safety prospective it makes sense (cabling, enough airflow between gear .. )

**Question 2:** **Does it really influence the sound?** - yes, because anything powered with electricity will produce vibrations and of course sound waves (e.g. lower end frequency/bass) from speakers as well. You know how important good feets and spikes are for speakers! Of course, it doesn't mean it is an major impact, but as **everything in Hifi, it's about synergy & Rack is part of it!** Let's get more technical here, we have 3 types of vibrations [^1]:

>_**"I believe capacitors, resistors, transistors, and other component parts are sensitive to vibration!"_**

- **Air-borne Vibration -** As we have seen, a speaker produces sound by moving air. Sound within the room causes vibrations-and/or resonances in the chassis, circuit board (s), and individual component parts of all electronic equipment. These vibrations induce various distortions in the signal, causing masking or veiling of the music to occur. Audiophiles have long been aware of the sensitive nature of tubes and tubed electronics to vibration. This condition has been termed microphonics when applied to the tube itself. Indeed, simply tapping on the glass envelope of a vacuum tube, or on the chassis of a very sensitive unit, produces audible emanations from the loudspeakers. In much the same way, but on a smaller scale, airborne (and structure-borne) vibrations will subtlety affect the sound produced by these units.

- **Structure-borne Vibration -** Structure boom vibrations affect equipment in much the same way as do their airborne counterparts, and generally to a greater degree. These vibrations create various colorations and distortions that blur or veil the music, confuse the image, and generally wreak sonic havoc. We can divide resonance control and isolation products into three categories based on their mode of operation. Coupling, decoupling, and energy conversion
  - **Coupling** devices tightly marry the component to the shelf. They include cones, spikes, and the like.  Spikes and cones, by decreasing the contact area with the support, (theoretically) act as a mechanical diode - allowing vibration to travel away from the component while limiting the return path. New materials now available (composite, ceramic, carbon fiber) seem to have improved cone performance over metal cones of the past.
  - **De-coupling** devices attempt to isolate the component from its resting place, usually with soft, resilient materials. Most audiophiles are familiar with soft de-coupling feet. These pliable, resilient, rubber-like pucks absorb vibrations, converting their motion to heat, dissipating their effect. Vibrapods are the most common today, their predecessors included Sorbothane (Audioquest) and NAVCOM (Sims Vibration Dynamics). Magnetic isolation is a form of de-coupling and this technology has been popularized by the Clear Audio Magix pods (now discontinued). Energy conversion products convert mechanical energy to heat. Though soft de-coupling materials perform a similar function, there are energy conversion devices on the market that do not use viscoelastic materials. The best example is the Stillpoints.

- **Self-Induced Vibration: -** Some damaging vibrations are created inside your stereo components. Obvious contributors would be CD drives, trays, and actuators whose mechanical movement creates vibrations that can travel through the structure, potentially affecting sensitive board-level circuit components. Less obvious, but in some ways more problematic, are transformers. All transformers vibrate and, just as with mechanical sources, the vibrations they create can influence sensitive circuitry. At the manufacturing level, damping of equipment chassis and isolating internal components from vibration can offer truly amazing sonic results. Manufacturers are just beginning to scratch the surface of this very important aspect of equipment design/construction. In most designs, vibrations in the cabinet and/or chassis are readily transmitted to the sensitive circuitry within. These vibrations are the cause of quite serious sonic aberrations that significantly limit the sonic potential of the component. Capacitors, in particular, are sensitive to mechanical vibration.

**SUMMATION:**

1. Do not place equipment in corners or directly behind speakers, especially planar designs.
2. Locate components and loudspeakers on a rigid, non-resonant support. Avoid enclosing equipment in cavities that will act as resonant chambers.
3. Experiment with cones, soft decoupling feet, or isolation feet or bases under all components.
4. Consider placing floor-mounted amplifiers on isolation bases.
5. Experiment with tube damper rings and/or isolation sockets on tubed electronics.
6. If you enjoy more advanced projects, consider damping internal circuit components, circuit boards, and equipment chassis.

>>**:notes: STEP #1: Let's see what's the Hifi market offers, from simple to more advanced ones.**

I realized the usual vendors like Solidsteel, State of the Art, Creaktiv or Solid Tech looked somehow similar. On the other hand very _cold design_ as many of them use mainly metal, which I don't like at all.

It was also interesting to experience real issues, to find a rack with some decent sized plates! What I mean with that?

- I need enough space for modern Hifi equipment, like placing an bigger solid AMP (e.g. my Rotel Michi X5)
- I wanna have enough space left on the plate, behind the equipment to place HighEnd cabling safely (e.g.: bigger power-outlets)
- HiFi chassis do have all kind of sizes and especially chassis-depth
- Of course stable standing, solid material and modular to add/remove levels
- Using material which are not resonating by default, like glass or metal
- ...always quite important: must fit our living room :smile:

>>**:notes: STEP #2: Define a basic, modular, nice-looking, wood-based DIY rack - with key absorber**

- Just use [draw.io](https://app.diagrams.net/) to create the initial design - Download my XML [here](/assets/article_images/2022-11-02-gerihifi-diy-hifirack/hifirack_en.drawio)
- It includes also absorber and spikes I use (BFly Audio & Viablue QTC)
- Wood: BauBuche Paneel (no idea how to translate into Englisch ;-)
- Oiling: Rubio Monocoat Oil plus 2C Havanna
- Screw thread size: M8 (pay attention to proper spikes for heavy load, I used up to 25kg per board and first one for 50kg)

**Some impressions....**
