My journey with ADC or is it D/A :thinking: . \
20+Y, I got rid of my large CD collection. I was never the Vinyl-guy and a big CD-chaser, before as many of us, I'd recorded anything what came closely to music on casette-deck (previously used by my C64 datassette).... your can assume, I'm not from the Z-Generation, more on the side of _'**I-AM-OLDER-THAN-THE-INTERNET**'_ :speak_no_evil:

Than I'd a long pause and started with more serious, dedicated listening HiFi gear again in 2009. Of course, far away from getting crazy and bought the usual consumer speakers, solid state integrated amp and cheap digital streamer (who cares about digital source, right, it's just doing 00111000). Of course, as a computer nerd, played around with several different DIY audio servers.
